# Hi there, I'm Melody! 🌸✨

### 👩‍💻 Self-Taught Developer | 🎮 Gamer | 📸 Photographer | 🏳️‍⚧️ Trans & Proud

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub! I’m a rookie developer finding my way through the world of code, one line at a time. I believe in **slow living**, intentional creation, and the magic of a well-baked loaf of bread.

### 🛠 My Tech Toolbox (So Far!)
I'm currently mastering the basics and building my foundation.
- **Web:** HTML5, CSS3
- **Scripting & Logic:** Python, C#
- **Game Dev:** GDScript (Godot)

### 🌱 What I’m Working On
- 🐍 Deepening my Python knowledge for Linux.
- 🎮 Experimenting with cozy game mechanics in Godot.
- 🎨 Making my CSS layouts look as soft and pretty as a sunset.

### 🍵 Beyond the Code
When I'm not debugging, you can usually find me:
- **In the Kitchen:** I love cooking, baking, and the art of homemaking. 🥖
- **With Nature:** Catching the perfect light through my camera lens. 🌿
- **Gaming:** Exploring immersive worlds and getting lost in a good story. 🕹️
- **Listening:** Music is my fuel—I'm almost always wearing headphones! 🎧

### 🐱 Fun Fact
I am a huge cat lover! If I’m stuck on a bug, a cat sitting on my lap (or my keyboard) usually helps... eventually.
